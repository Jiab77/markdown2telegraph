# md2tg

A small NodeJS binary that takes a markdown file and publish it on <https://telegra.ph>.

It is based on [telegraph.md](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraph.md) and [telegra.ph](https://github.com/telegraf/telegra.ph) projects.

You can check the code [here](https://github.com/Jiab77/md2tg/blob/main/index.js).

> The code is still quite __experimental__ at the moment... Please don't use it yet.
